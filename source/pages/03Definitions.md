# List of Words and their one-liner Definitions

*Includes links to internal pages where relevant.*

Some of the terms we use are very HTML-specific, following their conventions and terminology. For those not used to these conventions and to explain why we've made some of the design decisions that we have done, we've added a list of relevant words and their definitions.

Looking for a word but it's not below - [submit an issue](https://github.com/Volumetrics-io/documentation/edit/main/source/pages/03Definitions.md) to request the change or make a pull request to add the definition yourself!

## The List

- [_entity_](#entity)
