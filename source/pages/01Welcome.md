## What is MRjs

vv the below paragraph needs better more welcoming/less technical wording

MRjs is a mixed-reality-first, WebXR user interface library meant to bootstrap spatial web development. It implements much of the foundational work so that developers can spend less time on the basics and more time on their app.

It relies on the [Entity Component System framework](https://docs.mrjs.io/entity-component-system/) to make tags and items work as expected.
