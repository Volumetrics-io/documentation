# &lt;mr-img&gt;

The `<mr-img>` tag is used to embed an image in an `mrjs` page.

## Example

```html
<mr-img src="./images/puppy.jpg" alt="A puppy on a sofa"></mr-img>
```

## Definition and Usage

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<mr-img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The `<mr-img>` tag has two required attributes:

* `src` - Specifies the path to the image
* `alt` - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image, for some reason, cannot be displayed, or if the user uses a screen reader.
