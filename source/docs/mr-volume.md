# &lt;mr-volume&gt;

The `<mr-volume>`defines a grouping of 3D models in space. This is the same concept as `<mr-model>` and `<mr-img>` except instead of loading up a model or texture directly, it acts as a group (kind of like THREE.Group) that can contain more than one of these from a conceptual perspective.

## Definition and Usage

There are endless uses for `<mr-volume>`. The simplest of which is to group other elements together, such that they can be moved, rotated, scaled, and otherwise manipulated as a single entity.

?? todo - this seems the same as the catch all of mr-entity though except there's an additional clipping setup and there's a trigger for anchored. what information needs to be added here?
