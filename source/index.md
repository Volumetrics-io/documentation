# `mrjs` documentation

`mrjs` is an [open-source](https://github.com/Volumetrics-io/mrjs) spatial UI library

1. **Open-source and extendable**: Built on top of web standards, you can implement custom elements and contribute to the ecosystem.
2. **Familiar and powerful**: Looks and feels like existing libraries, but designed from the ground up for mixed-reality. Start with 2D and ease your way into creating 3D content.
3. **All-in-one**: Asset management, physics, and user interaction come built in, so you can spend less time laying the foundation and more time building your app.
