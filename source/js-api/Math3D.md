### Math3D.computeBoundingSphere(group, relativeTo) ⇒ <code>THREE.Sphere</code>
Computes the bounding sphere of an inputted three group object.

**Kind**: static method of [<code>Math3D</code>](#Math3D)  
**Returns**: <code>THREE.Sphere</code> - - the resolved bounding sphere  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| group | <code>THREE.group</code> | the group to be enclosed in the bounding sphere. |
| relativeTo | <code>THREE.group</code> | object that the group is relative to. For example if the group is an apple held in a character's hand, relativeTo would be the characters hand. When left as null, the bounding sphere defaults to the inputted groups original world matrix. |
